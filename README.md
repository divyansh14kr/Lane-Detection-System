# Lane Detection Project

This project is aimed at detecting lane lines on the road in a video feed. It utilizes computer vision techniques and the OpenCV library in Python.

## Features

- Detects lane lines using Canny edge detection and Hough transform
- Calculates average slope and intercept for left and right lane lines
- Draws detected lane lines on the original video feed
- Outputs a video with detected lane lines overlaid

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Run the Python script:


4. Press 'q' to exit the program.

## Customization

You can tweak parameters in the `lane_detection.py` file to adjust the lane detection algorithm according to your requirements.
